        "question_1": {
            "question": "Explain the difference between `torch.Tensor` and `torch.Variable` (if using an older PyTorch version) or  `torch.Tensor` and parameters in `torch.nn.Module` (for newer versions).  Why is this distinction important, and how does it relate to gradient calculations during training?  This tests basic understanding of core data structures and automatic differentiation.",
            "answer": "testing\n"
        },
        "question_2": {
            "question": "You are training a deep learning model and notice that your model's performance is poor on the validation set.  You suspect overfitting.  Describe several strategies you can implement using PyTorch to mitigate this issue.  Specifically mention how you would implement these strategies in code using relevant PyTorch functions or modules.  This assesses practical application, problem-solving, and knowledge of regularization techniques.",
            "answer": "testing"
        },
        "question_3": {
            "question": "Explain the concept of automatic differentiation in PyTorch and how it is implemented using the computational graph.  Describe a scenario where you might need to customize the automatic differentiation process (e.g., using `torch.autograd.grad`).  This explores deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of PyTorch's gradient calculations.",

        },
        "question_4": {
            "question": "You're training a model on a large dataset and notice that training is very slow.  Discuss various techniques you could use within PyTorch to improve training speed.  Consider aspects like data loading, GPU utilization, and model optimization.  This tests practical knowledge of performance optimization within the PyTorch framework.\n\nPlease provide your answers.",
