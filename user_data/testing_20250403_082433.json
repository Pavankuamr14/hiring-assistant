        "question_1": {
            "question": "Explain the difference between `torch.Tensor` and `torch.Variable` in PyTorch (if applicable to the version the candidate uses.  If they use a newer version, ask about `torch.Tensor` and its role in automatic differentiation).  Why is this distinction important (or was important in older versions)?  This assesses basic understanding of PyTorch's core data structures.",
            "answer": "torch.tensor is used to creating the tensor."
        },
        "question_2": {
            "question": "You are training a deep learning model and notice your GPU memory usage is very high.  What are some strategies you can implement in PyTorch to reduce memory consumption during training? (e.g., gradient accumulation, mixed precision training, smaller batch sizes, gradient checkpointing).  This tests practical experience with training models and dealing with real-world challenges.",
            "answer": "yes"
        },
        "question_3": {
            "question": "Describe how automatic differentiation works in PyTorch. What is the computational graph, and how does PyTorch use it to calculate gradients? This assesses understanding of a core PyTorch mechanism.",
            "answer": "testing"
        },
        "question_4": {
            "question": "You are training a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the loss is not decreasing. What are some debugging steps you would take in PyTorch to identify the problem? (e.g., checking for vanishing/exploding gradients, visualizing feature maps, verifying data loaders, examining the model architecture).  This tests practical debugging skills within the PyTorch context.",
            "answer": "test"
        },
        "question_5": {
            "question": "Describe how you would implement a custom loss function in PyTorch. Provide a simple code example for a common loss function like Mean Squared Error (MSE) implemented from scratch using PyTorch tensors and operations (without using the built-in `torch.nn.MSELoss`). This tests their ability to work with PyTorch's fundamental operations.\n\nPlease provide your answers.",
