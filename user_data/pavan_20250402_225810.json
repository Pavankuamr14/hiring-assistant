        "question_1": {
            "question": "Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python. When would you choose one over the other?  This assesses basic Python knowledge and understanding of data structures.",
            "answer": "list is mutable datatype and tuple is inmutable dataype.based on requirment\n"
        },
        "question_2": {
            "question": "You have a large text file where each line contains comma-separated values.  How would you efficiently read and process this file in Python, handling potential errors like missing values or incorrect data types? This tests practical application of Python for data processing, including error handling.",
            "answer": "using the numpy and pandas i will read the csv data. and try to fill the missing value with mean or median values\n"
        },
        "question_3": {
            "question": "What are NumPy arrays and what advantages do they offer over standard Python lists for numerical computations? How would you create a NumPy array from a Python list?  This checks understanding of a core library for machine learning and ability to convert between data structures.",
            "answer": "Numpy array are static the memory is allocated fixed and python list is uses dynamic memory allocation to store the data."
        },
        "question_4": {
            "question": "You have a Pandas DataFrame containing sales data with columns for 'Date', 'Product', and 'Revenue'. How would you use Pandas to calculate the total revenue generated by each product in a specific month? This tests practical application of Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, a common task in ML projects.",
            "answer": "i don't know\n"
        },
        "question_5": {
            "question": "Describe the concept of automatic differentiation in PyTorch.  How is it used in training neural networks?  Explain how to calculate gradients for a simple computation graph using PyTorch's `autograd` module. This explores a crucial concept in deep learning and PyTorch's implementation, showing if the candidate has moved beyond basic usage.  It requires both theoretical understanding and practical knowledge.\n\nPlease provide your answers.",
            "answer": "automatic differentiation in pytorch allow you to calculate the gradients. by using it you can adjust you model parameter like weights and bias.. use the autograd module to calculate the gradients"
