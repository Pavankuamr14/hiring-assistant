        "question_1": {
            "question": "Explain the difference between `torch.Tensor` and `torch.Variable` (if using an older PyTorch version) or `torch.Tensor` and the concept of requiring gradients in newer versions.  Why is this distinction important, and how does it relate to backpropagation?  This tests basic understanding of data structures and automatic differentiation.",
            "answer": "testing"
        },
        "question_2": {
            "question": "Imagine you are training a deep learning model and notice your GPU memory usage is very high. What are some strategies you can use within PyTorch to reduce memory consumption during training?  This assesses practical experience with training models and dealing with common issues.",

        },
        "question_3": {
            "question": "Describe how automatic differentiation works in PyTorch.  What is the computational graph, and how does PyTorch use it to calculate gradients?  This delves deeper into the inner workings of PyTorch's core functionality.",
            "answer": "testing"
        },
        "question_4": {
            "question": "Explain the difference between using `.detach()` and `.clone()` on a PyTorch tensor. When would you use each, and what are the implications for memory management and gradient tracking?  This tests a deeper understanding of tensor operations and memory management.\n\nPlease provide your answers.",
